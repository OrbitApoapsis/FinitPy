This is the repository for FinitPy, a Python 3 library for communicating with [finit.co](https://finit.co).

**Warning:** zero documentation ahead. Use at your own risk.

*finitclient.py* is the library

*finitcli.py* is the CLI client (this client is abandoned in favor of the GUI version)

*finitgui.py* is a GUI client written using tk

**Requirements:** tk and [websocket](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/websocket-client/) libraries.

None of the clients are complete and lack support for important features such as new PM notifications and polls.

Thanks to [@louis](https://finit.co/@louis) for his work in a Finit Bot in Python: https://github.com/602p/FinitBot, my code is based in his bot.

Thanks to [@robsob91](https://github.com/robsob91) and [@OrbitApoapsis](https://github.com/OrbitApoapsis) for contributing code to the project.
